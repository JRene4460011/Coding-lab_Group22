## Overview
This project implements a simple hospital log management system using **Bash scripting**. It allows a user to interactively select and archive live log files generated by hospital monitoring devices **without interrupting data collection**.

The system supports three types of logs:
1. Heart Rate
2. Temperature
3. Water Usage

Each log can be archived on demand with a timestamped filename for traceability and auditing.
