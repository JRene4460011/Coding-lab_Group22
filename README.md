# Coding-lab_Group22

## Overview
This project implements a simple hospital log management system using **Bash scripting**. It allows a user to interactively select and archive live log files generated by hospital monitoring devices **without interrupting data collection**.

The system supports three types of logs:
1. Heart Rate
2. Temperature
3. Water Usage

Each log can be archived on demand with a timestamped filename for traceability and auditing.

## 2. Analysis Script (analyze_logs.sh)

### Purpose
The analyze_logs.sh script provides an interactive way to analyse archived or active hospital logs.  
It extracts device statistics and temporal patterns from the selected log file and appends the results to a report.

### How It Works

#### 1. Interactive Menu
When executed, the script displays:

1) Heart Rate
2) Temperature
3) Water Usage

The user selects a log file by entering a number between **1 and 3**.

#### 2. Input Validation
The script validates that:
The user input is valid (1–3)
The selected log file exists
The log file is not empty

If any condition fails, the script prints an error message and exits safely.

#### 3. Data Analysis
Using Linux text-processing tools, the script:
Counts the total number of entries per device
Determines the **first** and **last** timestamp recorded for each device

The following commands are used:
awk – extract device names and timestamps
sort and uniq – count occurrences per device
head and tail – identify first and last log entries
grep – filter device-specific records
